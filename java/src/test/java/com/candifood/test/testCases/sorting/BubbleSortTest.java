/**
 * Tested: Yes
 * <p/>
 * The bubble-sort algorithm makes various passes over a one-dimensional array.
 * For each pass, that algorithm compares adjacent data items to determine which
 * is numerically larger or smaller. Either the larger data item (for ascending
 * order) or the smaller data item (for descending order) swaps with the
 * adjacent data item and moves toward the bottom of the one-dimensional array.
 * By the end of the pass, the largest/smallest data item has moved toward the
 * array's end. This "bubbling" effect is the origin of the bubble-sort
 * algorithm's name.
