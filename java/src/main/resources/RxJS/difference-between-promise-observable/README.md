# Promise and observable

Promises and Observables is that Promises MULTICAST (share the same result) and Observables UNICAST (by default each observer gets own copy of the result,but this can be customized with RxJS powers 😍).


#### **promise is MULTICAST**
share the same result
 
####  **Observables UNICAST**

by default each observer gets own copy of the result,but this can be customized with RxJS powers 😍
