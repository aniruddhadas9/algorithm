/*

Neither 21, nor 20, the result is undefined

It’s because JavaScript initialization is not hoisted.

(Why doesn’t it show the global value of 21? The reason is that when the function is executed
, it checks that there’s a local x variable present but doesn’t yet declare it, so it won’t look for global one.)

// it will be
var x = 21;
var girl = function () {
    var x;
    console.log(x);
    x = 20;
