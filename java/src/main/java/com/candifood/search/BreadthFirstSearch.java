 * Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
 * It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1]) and
 * explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
