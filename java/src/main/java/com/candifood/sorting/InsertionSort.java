 * Tested: not tested yet

 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
 * It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * Every repetition of insertion sort removes an element from the input data, inserting it into the correct position in the already-sorted list,
 * until no input elements remain. The choice of which element to remove from the input is arbitrary, and can be made using almost any choice algorithm.
