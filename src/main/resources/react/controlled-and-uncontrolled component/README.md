# difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled component




### controlled component
A controlled component is a component where React is in control and is the single source of truth for the form data.

As you can see below, username doesnâ€™t live in the DOM but instead lives in our component state. Whenever we want to update username, we call setState as weâ€™re used to.


```javascript

class ControlledForm extends Component {
  state = {
    username: ''
  }
  updateUsername = (e) => {
    this.setState({
      username: e.target.value,
    })
  }
  handleSubmit = () => {}
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          value={this.state.username}
          onChange={this.updateUsername} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}

```

### uncontrolled component
An uncontrolled component is where your form data is handled by the DOM, instead of inside your React component.

> You use refs to accomplish this.

```javascript
class UnControlledForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value: ", this.input.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={(input) => this.input = input} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```
