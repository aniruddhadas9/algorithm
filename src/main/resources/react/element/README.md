# Element



##### difference between createElement and cloneElement?

 - createElement is what JSX gets transpiled to and is what React uses to create React Elements (object representations of some UI). 
 - cloneElement is used in order to clone an element and pass it new props. 

They nailed the naming on these two ðŸ™‚.
