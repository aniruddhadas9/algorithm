// What is the value of typeof undefined == typeof NULL?

console.log( typeof undefined == NULL);

/*
The expression will be evaluated to true, since NULL will be treated as any other undefined variable.

Note: JavaScript is case-sensitive and here we are using NULL instead of null

/*
string

typeof 1 will return "number" and typeof "number" will return string.
