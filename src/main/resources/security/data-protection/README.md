 - Triple-DES
 - RC4
 - Blowfish
 - Twofish
 
 
 Exam:
 
 data is at rest when: store such as database
 When a system uses one key for encryption and a seperate provate key for decryption, it is using: Asymmetric cryptography
 When a system uses one  same key for encryption and decryption, it is using: Symmetric cryptography
 When a system transfer sensitive data into a fixed length string that can be used for comparison purpose later: Hashing Function
